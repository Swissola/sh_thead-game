# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-25)

**Core value:** A friend can join a room from any device (phone, desktop, either OS) and play a full game with you in real time.

Phase: 1 of 7 (Rules Engine Refactor)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-25 — Roadmap created from ingested planning doc (7-stage plan → 7 phases), 32 v1 requirements mapped with full coverage

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime + anonymous auth) chosen for the multiplayer backend
- Pre-roadmap: Capacitor chosen to wrap the existing React app for Android/iOS, no separate native UI
- Pre-roadmap: Desktop ships as a responsive web app (PWA-installable), no Tauri/Electron
- Pre-roadmap: Refactor-first sequencing — Phase 1 (rules engine) is a hard dependency for Phase 2 (multiplayer)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

None yet. Note for Phase 1 planning: codebase audit found `App.tsx` mutates
state in place (`playCards`, `App.tsx:461-834`), `playerId` is never actually
set (`App.tsx:62`), and rules logic is duplicated across `App.tsx`/`Hand.tsx`/
`Table.tsx` — all in scope for Phase 1, not new discoveries to re-investigate.
